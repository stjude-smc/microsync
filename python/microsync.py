        In continuous mode, laser shutters remain open during the entire acquisition
        and the camera is triggered at precise intervals. The first frame is
        automatically discarded as it contains pre-acquisition noise.

        In stroboscopic mode, the laser shutter is briefly opened during each camera

        the optional frame_period parameter, which can be used to add a delay between
        laser pulses for timelapse acquisition.

        In ALEX mode, frames are acquired in bursts, with each frame in a burst

        wavelengths.
