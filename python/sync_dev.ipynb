    "Some pins (see *globals.h*) are assigned to laser shutters. These are additionally controlled by an interlock. The interlock periodically sends a short heart beat pulse on pin D13 and expects to receive this pulse on pin D12. If the pulse does not arrive, the laser shutter pins are immediately set to TTL low. The pins return to their normal function as soon as interlock detects pulse on D12. This mechanism does not affect the enable/disable status of the pins or their internal level, it's a separate layer of logic.\n",
